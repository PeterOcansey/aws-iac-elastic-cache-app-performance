## Improve Application Performance using Amazon ElasticCache

### Database
Let's begin by spinning up database for our python application, as per the challenge requirement, we will be using Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) Postgresql. Amazon RDS makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.

From the terminal, execute

`bash bash_scripts/create.sh 'your_stack_name_here'  iac-rds-pgsql.yml iac-rds-params.json`
